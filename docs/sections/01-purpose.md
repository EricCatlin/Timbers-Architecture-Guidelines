title: Section 1 — Purpose & Guiding Principles
---

**Design Intent:** Preserve a cohesive, modern Craftsman aesthetic while encouraging quality construction and allowing reasonable personalization.

1. **Preserve Architectural Harmony** — Maintain or improve the modern Craftsman aesthetic of the neighborhood (CC&Rs §11.5).  
2. **Encourage Quality Construction** — Use durable materials and best practices to avoid adverse impacts.  
3. **Ensure Predictability** — Provide clear criteria so homeowners know what is likely to gain approval.  
4. **Respect Individual Expression** — Allow personalization while preserving cohesiveness.  
5. **Extend City/County/State Codes** — HOA approval does not replace permits; provide proof of permitting.
