title: Section 3 â€” Exterior Color & Finish
---

**Design Intent:** Maintain subdued, harmonious colorways consistent with modern Craftsman style.

### Color Palette
- Muted, earthy colors (grays, taupes, beiges, subdued blues/reds).
- No bright/fluorescent colors on large exterior surfaces.
- White/off-white trims encouraged for uniformity.

### Material Finishes
- **Preferred:** fiber-cement siding (e.g., Hardie Board).
- **Disallowed:** vinyl siding (per prior Board resolutions).

### Repainting
- **Same color:** no ACC approval required.  
- **New color:** **ACC application required** with color chips or manufacturer details.
