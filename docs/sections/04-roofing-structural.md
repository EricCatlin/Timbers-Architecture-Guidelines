### Roofing Standards
- **Standard:** asphalt shingles in muted colors (dark gray, brown, black).
- **Specialty materials:** metal, clay tile, etc. are **not permitted** unless they closely resemble asphalt and receive explicit ACC approval.

### Structural Changes
- Major exterior expansions/remodels must maintain consistent roofing, siding, and design.
- Any new roof line, dormer, or significant change to the home’s shape requires **ACC approval**.
