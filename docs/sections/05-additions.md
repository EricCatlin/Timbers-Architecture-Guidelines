title: Section 5 â€” Additions & Modifications
---

### Major Additions
- Adding rooms, second-story expansions, or garage extensions requires ACC review.
- Provide professional plans or detailed homeowner plans (dimensions, materials, roof lines).

### Neighbor Impacts
- Projects should **not** cause unreasonable obstruction of adjacent views or sunlight.
- Second-story decks/balconies are discouraged unless original to design; they require privacy scrutiny.

### Submission Materials
- Plot plan, elevations, and explanation of how new materials match the existing home.
