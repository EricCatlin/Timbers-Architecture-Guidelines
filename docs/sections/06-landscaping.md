### Front Yard Overhauls
- Changes to **>20%** of front yard material/purpose require ACC review.
- Removal/addition of **trees over 15 ft** requires ACC review.
- **Artificial turf** in front yards is permitted **if high quality and professionally installed**.  
  - Must be regularly weeded and color-matched to organic grass.  
  - Material specs must be included in the ACC review.

### Retaining Walls & Raised Beds
- Walls **over 2 ft** or that significantly change drainage require ACC review.
- Raised vegetable beds are discouraged in front yards; back/side yards are preferable.

### Walking Paths
- Use pavers rather than poured concrete to align with permeable surface requirements.

#### Turf Quality Checklist (Guidance)
- Pile height ≥ 1.5 in; face weight ≥ 60 oz/sq yd.  
- UV-stabilized yarn; realistic multi-tone.  
- Permeable backing; proper infill and sub-base prep.
